Abstract
Machine learning is a rapidly-evolving technology that has permeated multiple areas of human life, making it easier in 
many ways. One of the fields that have seen significant progress due to machine learning is image recognition. Applications 
like face recognition, item classification, and medical diagnosis have been revolutionized by the use of image recognition techniques.

One such application that has gained significant attention is vehicle counting and classification.
This software uses computer vision to classify vehicles and count them on the road, providing critical 
information for making decisions about traffic signal duration, estimated time of arrival, and more. However, 
the performance of traditional approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be hindered by the ever-changing models of vehicles.

Instead, a promising alternative approach called Zero-shot learning has emerged, offering advantages over traditional methods. 
This approach uses examples of a few seen classes and some auxiliary information to predict an unseen class, significantly 
reducing the size of the dataset and training time. Zero-shot learning holds the potential to revolutionize vehicle counting 
and classification and may find applications in other areas of image recognition as well.
